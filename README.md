# Color HSL Generator

This project generates a color palette based on a given hex color and step value.
The palette is generated by interpolating the hex color in the HSL color space.
The step value is used to determine the increment of the hue, saturation and lightness values.

The project uses the following dependencies:

-   `color-convert`: A library for converting between different color spaces.
-   `dotenv`: A library for loading environment variables from a `.env` file.
-   `express`: A web framework for Node.js.
-   `winston`: A logging library for Node.js.

## Routes

The project has the following routes:

-   `GET /hsl/:hex`: Returns a color palette based on the given hex color and step value.
-   `GET /hsl/:hex?step=:step`: Returns a color palette based on the given hex color and step value.

## Response

The response is a JSON object with the following properties:

-   `colors`: An object with the colors of the palette.
-   `mainColor`: An object with the properties of the main color.

The `colors` object has the following properties:

-   `hex`: An object with the hex values of the colors.
-   `rgb`: An object with the RGB values of the colors.
-   `hsl`: An object with the HSL values of the colors.

The `mainColor` object has the following properties:

-   `hex`: The hex value of the main color.
-   `index`: The index of the main color in the palette.

## Example

The following is an example of the response for the route `GET /hsl/ff0000`:
